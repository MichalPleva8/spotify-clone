# How to Install and Run the Project ? 

- In order to run this project you need to install packages in the **/** and **/client** by running in your terminal

```
npm install
```
- You also need to create ``` .env ``` file in your **/server** directory and it needs to contain:
```
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECREAT=
MONGO_URL=
```
- You can get your spotify credentails at [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
- And MONGO_URL from your local server or other source

- After that you need to run express server and react app at the same time 
- In one terminal go to **/client** and run ``` npm start ```
- In one terminal go to **/** and run ``` npm start ```
