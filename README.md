# How to Install and Run the Project ? 

- In order to run this project you need to install packages in the **/** and **/client** by running in your terminal

```
npm install
```

- After that you need to run express server and react app at the same time 
- In one terminal go to **/client** and run ``` npm start ```
- In one terminal go to **/** and run ``` npm start ```

# Future ideas

* I would like to implement changing songs by dragging the coverflow by mouse
